This is aka Law of Demeter or Principle of Least Knowledge

We should only invoke methods that belongs to:

1...the object itself
2...objects passed in as a parameter to the method
3...any object the method creates  or instantiates
4...any components of the object


public class Car{

Engine engine
//other instance variables

public Car(){
//instantiate the engine etc.
}
public void start(Keys keys){
Doors doors = new Doors();
boolean authorized = key.turns();  // 2

if(authorized) {
engine.start(); //1
updateDashBoardDisplay(); //4
doors.lock(); //3
}
}
