To find the mid point, don't do (start+end)/2, do like start+(end-start)/2

Do not start coding straight away... first think how you gonna solve the problem

Two pointer is a good technique.

To find the max in a given array of integers, use the Math.max function as 
max = Math.max(arr[i], max);

try to avoid too many if conditions

ALWAYS analyse the boundary conditions.

If possible go for the recursive implementation.
